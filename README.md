# Sporty Achievers👋 
### Full Stack Blockchain Development ✨
<p> ETH Global Paris Hackathon submission</p>
<p>A platform for athletes to gain more visibility globally and acquire scholarships easily 
with off-chain credential verification (Proof of Achievement) and fully decentralized payment</p>


What we learned:
* Create, compile & deploy  smart contracts to EVM-compatible chain incl. polygon Mumbai, Celo, Sepolia, Linea, using Hardhat.
* Using Hyperlane for bridging  
* Create, compile, and deploy a Subgraph to The Graph's Hosted Service.
* Build a Subgraph that indexes data from a smart contract to query blockchain data to the dapp.
* Learn to use Biconomy: Social account / Account abstraction for login and authentication 
* Learn to use Push Protocol to send notifications once a payment is made
